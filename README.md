App is started by running the "A3" file.

Uses the Java Swing framework to create an app that creates a "bouncing area" for different shapes to bounce with different bounce paths.
A "nested" shape creates a bouncing shape that is itself a bouncing area.
Users can add shapes to and remove shapes from the bouncing area (and any nested bouncing areas).

This project demonstrates OOP programming techniques, recursive structures, GUI design, and design patterns.
